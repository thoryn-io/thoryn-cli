# Homebrew formula for the `thoryn` customer-plane CLI (SSO-2936, epic SSO-2934).
#
# This formula lives IN the thoryn-cli repo so the repo doubles as its own tap:
#
#     brew tap thoryn-io/thoryn-cli
#     brew install thoryn
#
# It installs the prebuilt GraalVM native-image binary from the matching GitHub
# Release (tag `cli-v#{version}`, published by .github/workflows/release.yml).
#
# The `version` line and the `sha256` lines below are rewritten on every
# tagged release by scripts/release/bump-formula.sh, which the release workflow
# runs and commits back to the default branch. Native binaries are best-effort
# per runner availability, so a platform whose binary was not produced is omitted
# here rather than pointed at a missing download. Do NOT hand-edit — bump by
# cutting a `cli-v*` tag.
